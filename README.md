# AsciiLab

Making it easy to version Asciidoctor in Git and convert to:

-> An intranet!
-> A PDF!


## Architecture

The basic idea is to have a Git host push things to an API, which then updates... stuff.

     +--------+  |  |              +--------------+                  | |            |
                 |  |              +---------------------+           | | PostgreSQL |
                 |  |              | API server (kotlin) |           | |            |
                 |  |              +---------------------+           | +------------+
                 |  |              +--------------------+            |
                 |  |              | Admin App          |            |  
                 |  |              +--------------------+            |
                 |  |                                                |
    Peeps+-------+  +------------------------------------------------+

That whole bit on the right should be a deployable Docker container, with the option for another one for PostgreSQL.

### API Server

- Spring Boot 5 app
- use asciidoctorj (for JVM usage) for conversion
- use jgit for git interop

NOTE: We may want options for background processes to handle some operations.

### Possible: Admin Application

We may want to configure a little web application that provides the ability to initialize and administer the server. 


### Decisions, Decisions

#### Using Kotlin-based views for admin

In some ways this is an experiment, trying to limit the number of tools and languages in use down to: Just Use Kotlin.
The View templates are really just functions that write directly to a writer.
Thus, there is no "load script and cache it" kind of thing going on.
And, it's awfully nice to have a real language for doing views: we can add complex configuraitons, etc, with pretty minimal pain.

The disadvantage is that we're really rolling new territory in terms of output writing performance.
I have no idea if this is going to be a problem yet at all.
So I suspect as things grow we'll need to figure out where the bottlenecks are and adjust.

#### Using blocking JDBC

So, while all the APIs are going to be mostly reactive, it turns out that, well, Java hasn't really standardized on async APIs for JDBC.
Some projects, like [postgres-async-driver](https://github.com/alaisi/postgres-async-driver) are blazing trails in this area.

The problem, is that I only see basic functionality, and no roadmap.
So interesting features, like the Copy API are unavailable.
I'm reticent to jump into a brand new driver since I've used the copy API to completely shift performance of PG interop.
And when I search the mailing lists for postgres, I really don't see a lot of chatter for async tooling.

So... yeah, going to be slightly "custom" `ReactiveRepository` style interfaces that basically wrap an underlying `Repository`.
This allows us to stick with our "handler" basically using the `BodyInserter` style API.
Our reactive implementation will just probably have to manage it's own coroutine context and proxy.

#### NOT Using Spring-Data

I'm continuing an experiment where I'm avoiding all AOP, with all the scanning, etc and automatic proxies etc.
This means that a lot of Spring projects, like spring data, end up getting skipped.
We DO want to maintain some consistency, however that will be another project.

#### Spring Boot's @ConfigProperties Doesn't Allow Idiomatic Usage

See: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/8762

Personally, given that I'm _also_ not using AOP, this makes `@ConfigurationProperties` kind of a moot point.


## Product Concepts

Two versions:

1. Open Source (single Git repo)
2. Enterprise (protected pages, auth, search, etc)

Value proposition:

The idea is that a group chooses this over, say, a stupid Wiki server like Confluence. (Wikis! Booo.)

The primary workflow is just simply to push changes to a master branch in a repo.

Repo setup:

    index.adoc <- literally your home page
    sub_dir/index.adoc <- becomes the index of a web page

Now, this may be too simple, so we can add a "descriptor" that allows you to state "hey this is for the website".


## TO DO

- Add nginx proxy :
    - /static (local files?)
    - /admin (admin server)
    - /api (api server)
 


- Add REPO admin page
- ... moar


Consider an integrated smoke testing suite.
